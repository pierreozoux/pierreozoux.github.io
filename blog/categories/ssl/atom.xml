    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just read <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141120073425-26662417-why-i-won-t-be-using-let-s-encrypt-and-recommend-other-not-to-also">an article</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/alexanderhanff/">alexanderhanff</a> against <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t let it go.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>If you don&rsquo;t know yet <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a> project, I recommend going to their page and get to know! It is really good idea, but apparently some people disagree.</p>

<h2>Commenting the article itself</h2>

<p>&ldquo;[this new CA] will become a target&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure NSA will just go to other authorities for this kind of jobs. If I am NSA, I would feel ashame to go to EFF ask to fake a certificate to spy on people. They are already doind it, and they&rsquo;ll just continue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;why on earth would a terrorist pay Verisign for an SSL certificate, leaving a paper trail, if they can obtain an anonymous certificate for free from Let&rsquo;s Encrypt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh well, I think you don&rsquo;t really get the project. How could/would you obtain a certificate for a domain you don&rsquo;t own? Your certificate is linked to a domain name, and to buy a domain name, you don&rsquo;t have much choice than paying by credit card, and giving your ID.</p>

<p>And why are you speaking about terrorist? I really don&rsquo;t get your point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;it removes all confidence in TLS certificates as far as I am concerned and I will absolutely not be using the service&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh well, it is the same as right now. Do you trust verisign? So why not trusting let&rsquo;s encrypt (at the same level at least)? TLS certificate is broken. We know it! Nothing new with what you are saying. So I don&rsquo;t see the point of ranting about Let&rsquo;s Encrypt when you have nothing better to propose!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think you can&rsquo;t speak seriously in this article. I think you are just a troll, and I just lost 20 minutes of my life answering. But I really believe it&rsquo;s important to discuss about these issues. Maybe there is something I didn&rsquo;t understand, please let me know!</p>

<h2>To go further</h2>

<p>About ssl certificate authority, I recommend this talk if you didn&rsquo;t already see it.</p>
