I wanted to introduce you my attempt to create a shared repository for Packer Template. Please, feel free to comment!

<!-- more -->

Here it is on GitHub : [Packer-warehouse](https://github.com/pierreozoux/packer-warehouse)

I really would like to hear you on how you would use it, do you think it's convenient.. What is missing? Thanks for your help! And if you like it, spread the word!

And a little bonus [the presentation](/presentations/packer.html) I gave yesterday about Packer at [require('lx')](http://www.meetup.com/require-lx/)!
