After [searching](https://github.com/pierreozoux/ideas) [a long time](http://pierre.oz.free.fr/) on how to 
build/install/join a federated social web, I found the Graal. Lately, I met Michiel B. de Jong, and 
[he convinced](https://michielbdejong.com/blog/8.html) me to switch to 
[Indie web](http://indiewebify.me/)! I'll write posts on how I'm doing it!

My idea right now is to use Octopress, hosted by GitHub pages. I plan to use [webmention.io](http://webmention.io/) and 
[brid.gy](https://www.brid.gy/)

I hope you'll enjoy, and please let me know if you have questions or want to know more!
