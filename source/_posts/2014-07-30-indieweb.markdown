After [searching](https://github.com/pierreozoux/ideas) [a long time](http://pierre.oz.free.fr/) on how to build/install/join a federated social web, I found the Graal. Lately,
I met Michiel B. de Jong, and he convinced me to switch to [Indie web](http://indiewebify.me/)! I'll write posts on how to do it with octopress!

I hope you'll enjoy, and please let me know if you have questions or want to know more!
